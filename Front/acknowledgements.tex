Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Marcela Ruiz, for her guidance, perseverance and support throughout the course of this research. Her expertise and insights have helped me in the conceptualisation of this thesis, and her encouragement and constructive criticism have been instrumental in my academic and professional growth.

I would also like to extend my sincerest thanks to the participants who took the time to complete my survey. I am grateful for the input provided by all participants, whose contributions have enabled the collection of essential data and perspectives, which have significantly enhanced the quality of this research.
The completion of this thesis would not have been possible without the contributions and support of all those who have assisted me in this endeavour.
