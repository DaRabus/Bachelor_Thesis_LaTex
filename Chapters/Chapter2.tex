\section{Current State of art}

The transition to cloud computing is reshaping the landscape of software development and operations practices, with cloud-native architectures becoming increasingly common. This shift is introducing a vast array of tools and practices that organisations must navigate, driven by the rapid development of cloud-native technologies. The complexity of selecting, tracking and adapting these technologies for enterprise environments presents significant challenges. Within this evolving ecosystem, DevOps emerges as a critical element, merging software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to streamline system development lifecycles and improve software quality.

However, despite its growing adoption, the concept of DevOps lacks a consistent academic definition. It encompasses a range of interpretations, from toolchains and cultural practices to job titles and responsibilities. Humble and Molesky (2011) identify four fundamental pillars of DevOps:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Culture:} Sharing the responsibility for the deliverance of software
    \item \textbf{Automation:} Automation is a good tool to increase the processes
    \item \textbf{Measurement:} Quantified processes are helping to understand capability and setting goals
    \item \textbf{Knowledge Sharing:} How to share the knowledge is the most crucial point
\end{itemize}

Of these, Knowledge Sharing is of central importance as it underpins the effective adoption of DevOps practices and facilitates knowledge management in the organisation. \cite{HumbleMolesky2011}
