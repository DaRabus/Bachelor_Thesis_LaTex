# ZHAW thesis template
This is a template for LaTeX thesis (M.Sc. or PhD) at [Zurich University of Applied Sciences, ZHAW](https://www.zhaw.ch/).
This repository was created to relieve future students of the tedious work of thesis formatting. 
Make sure that it meets your programme specific requirements and the details that need to be discussed with the supervisor. 

## Contribution 
Feel free to contribute to this project to improve it. 

## Versions
For major (i.e. study program specific) changes, I suggest to have multiple branches which are going to be explained here. 
The current master branch was used for a Master thesis of the [Applied Computational Life Sciences Master program](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/lsfm/institutes-centres/ias/study-teaching/master/) at the [Institute of Applied Simulations](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/lsfm/institutes-centres/ias-institute-of-applied-simulation/) from the department [Life Science and Facility Management](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/lsfm/).
